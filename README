This contains the following:

1. Cherry picked bcache patches that either fix some issues or add additional functionality:

01-bypass-4.20.patch adds the option to enable/disable cache bypass for readahead/background I/O (Only for kernel 4.20) -> https://gitlab.com/snippets/1820316
01-bypass-4.19.82.patch same as above but fixed to apply to 4.19.82
02-journal_replay.patch fixes a journal replay issue (4.20 only) -> https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-bcache/msg07027.html
03-70c214fe7e80f23281ee3549cc2c4ed170b0f7ad.patch fixes (4.20 only, included in 4.19.82) a panic when trim is running -> https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10773357/
04-de05533d9d1e458a9d22f65467f8fa3b3e9ffb13.patch adds caching decisions based on set ioprio (for example when you want 1 program to always cache to bcache but not the rest) -> https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9820443/

2. A vanilla 4.20.17 kernel with patches 01-bypass-4.20.patch , 02-journal_replay.patch , 03-70c214fe7e80f23281ee3549cc2c4ed170b0f7ad.patch and 04-de05533d9d1e458a9d22f65467f8fa3b3e9ffb13.patch applied.
3. A vanilla 4.19.82 LTS kernel with patches 01-bypass-4.19.82.patch , 04-de05533d9d1e458a9d22f65467f8fa3b3e9ffb13.patch
4. A kernel config shamelessly copied from xanmod 4.20.10-xanmod6 (cheers to xanmod for making an awesome kernel)
5. A kernel config shamelessly copied from xanmod 4.19.81-xanmod39
6. Prebuilt packages for Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 (that you should use at your own risk)
