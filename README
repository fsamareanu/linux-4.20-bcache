This contains the following:

1. Cherry picked bcache patches that either fix some issues or add additional functionality:

01-bypass.patch adds the option to enable/disable cache bypass for readahead/background I/O
02-journal_replay.patch fixes a journal replay issue
03-70c214fe7e80f23281ee3549cc2c4ed170b0f7ad.patch fixes a panic when trim is running
04-de05533d9d1e458a9d22f65467f8fa3b3e9ffb13.patch adds caching decisions based on set ioprio (for example when you want 1 program to always cache to bcache but not the rest)

2. A vanilla 4.20.17 kernel with above patches
3. A kernel config shamelessly copied from xanmod 4.20.10-xanmod6 (cheers to xanmod for making an awesome kernel)
